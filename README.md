# Esports League Tracker

Esports League Tracker is an application dedicated to all members of the professional League of Legends ecosystem. Viewers can buy tickets and look up their favourite teams and players, organizers can easily add and update information, and analysts can examine statistics and trends that have occurred throughout the leagueâ€™s history. Built using the Oracle database system on Java/JDBC, this app includes three user interfaces: viewers and fans, analysts, and league organizers.

Overall, our project has accomplished these main goals:
* Provide a multi-faceted esports league application and DBMS for viewers of the league, employees and analysts
* Allow viewers to buy, sell, refund and track their tickets as well as league info, such as teams, games, and historical rosters
* Allow employees to insert, change, and delete information that is crucial to the viewing experience, such as games, teams, rosters, and overall season achievements
* Allow analysts to examine interesting and insightful statistics on viewership, team performance, and sales
